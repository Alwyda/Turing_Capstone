The German gas stations dataset lists every active gas station in Germany with its geographical data and all price changes of diesel, gasoline E5 and gasoline E10 from June 2014 until April 2023, calculated per month.

The analysis of the German gas stations dataset was based on the assumption that gas station network density, fuel types and fuel prices at a pump might reflect regional economic differences of federal states. Investigating these differences might in turn offer possibilities for further cohesion and suggest some points of focus for targeted regional measures that could lead to price reduction.

Data is analyzed in 3 geographical distribution plots of: 
gas stations,
fuel types,
fuel prices.

Concerning <b>gas station distribution</b>, the significantly lesser number of gas stations in the Eastern region reflects the population decline in that part of the country.

Diesel was the most prevalent <b>type of fuel</b>, with nearly all gas stations having it in their offer. The part of gas stations that sell only diesel partly correlates with the main agricultural regions of the country.

<b>Fuel prices</b> follow global and national events. Significant regional differences among federal states were detected, but they seem not to stem from any national long-term trends. 

Contrary to the primary hypothesis, fuel prices do not directly correlate with the economic standing of federal states. However, at least in the first third of the year 2023, higher fuel prices in the Eastern region might be related to the Russian pipeline servicing Germany from the East. Targeted regional measures for price reduction should especially be focused on the federal lands that constantly top the list for the most expensive fuel.
